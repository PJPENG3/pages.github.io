I am **Jingan Peng**, a Ph.D. student in Industrial & Systems Engineering at the University of Oklahoma.  
My research focuses on **VR-based experiments**, **fNIRS signal analysis**, **eye-tracking**, and **human performance evaluation** in human-automation systems.

I currently work on several projects involving:

- VR arithmetic tasks combined with fNIRS to study cognitive workload and infrared interference  
- Analysis of human comfort, trust, and behavior in ACC and CACC automated driving systems  
- Motion artifact correction and signal-cleaning pipelines for fNIRS data  
- VR educational interface design and learning performance assessment

Beyond research, I have hands-on experience building VR experiments, developing data-processing pipelines in Python and R, conducting peak-frequency and time-series analyses, and supporting simulation-based human factors studies. I also serve as a teaching assistant for Simulation and Data-Driven Decision Making.

My long-term goal is to develop reliable, data-driven methods that support human-centered system design, and to continue growing as an independent researcher working across VR, cognition, and human-automation interaction.
